3.  **Technical Settings:** `ISO 400, f/2.8 aperture, 1/500s shutter speed, shot in RAW format` - Provides realistic camera settings for a portrait shot.
4.  **Lighting:** `professional studio lighting setup with key light and fill light, soft rim lighting` - Directs the AI to use complex, professional lighting.

### Tips for Best Results:

*   **Change the Subject:** Feel free to replace "young woman" with any subject (e.g., "old man with a beard," "a dog," "a futuristic robot").
*   **Adjust Lighting:** Experiment with different lighting setups like "dramatic chiaroscuro lighting" or "soft window light."
*   **Model Specifics:** This prompt works best with models that excel at photorealism, such as Midjourney V6 or Stable Diffusion with a realistic checkpoint.
